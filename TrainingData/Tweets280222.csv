@MartinGilbert83 @NStoronsky guys I've been waiting an almost a week for this resolution and not getting anywhere !!! I am getting a bot on chat explaining the same thing that someone will get back to me but no one is ? Has @RevolutApp having liquidity issues ? @ecb,,,,,,,
"@JcFlore72359181 @HSBC_UK I'm not going to give my credentials to anyone, thanks but no thanks",,,,,,,
@HSBC_UK Done,,,,,,,
@santanderukhelp Not acceptable. An hour and a half and still to not get through to someone is just madness so still unresolved! Pathetic,,,,,,,
"@adadithya Not any unique policy that I can think of but, @HSBC masters in executing all their employee centric policies really well to the last tier. 
That literally enhanced my productivity and efficiency at work by 40-50%, during my 1 year association with @HSBC_UK",,,,,,,
"@HSBC_UK The video is to show everyone how impossible it is to speak to a human at HSBC.  I gave up, I phoned instead, I waited 25 minutes and was told that I couldn't make a payment because of ""a glitch"", no resolution whatsoever.",,,,,,,
@monzo do you provide LISA‚Äôs? Can‚Äôt see the option to open one in the app,,,,,,,
@tink SIX months and your API linking @TSB and @Xero is woefully inadequate. What's the latest with getting this sorted? @Xero don't have a clue. Perhaps you do?,,,,,,,
@CooperativeBank Please reply quickly as I‚Äôm worried security has been compromised,,,,,,,
"@CooperativeBank please let me know if you have a formal complaint registered from ourselves.
Martin your advisor rang me back and tried to get the second two digits of my password and I‚Äôm worried about fraud",,,,,,,
@RevolutApp  Hi there. I'd like to close my account due to the fact that in Colombia isn't available your service. How can I do that if I can't even set up the passcode?,,,,,,,
@santanderukhelp Will do. Thanks,,,,,,,
"@daveyboydanger @CooperativeBank It‚Äôs an absolute nightmare Dave! 
Nearly 2 hours on the phone and no further on. All we want to do is use our card online üò°

"@HalifaxBank Good afternoon, could you tell me if my local branch are able to certify a copy of my birth certificate?",,,,,,,
"@HalifaxBank Apologies, my mistake. But in my defence, the print quality on the letter isn't great. Anyway, I've completed the form and it's gone through so all sorted. Thank-you.",,,,,,,
"@RBS_Help Why DM, No need now for assistance‚Ä¶ I wanted that in branch..",,,,,,,

"@santanderukhelp I‚Äôve just spent an hour on hold with your security team because there‚Äôs a block on my joint savings account - he said he wasn‚Äôt sure why the back office have blocked it, and he doesn‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll take. I have money in there that I can‚Äôt transfer out?",,,,,,,

"@santanderukhelp No, he said he couldn‚Äôt tell me how long.",,,,,,,
@RevolutApp can‚Äôt get into account. Please help urgent,,,,,,,
I spent over an hour @NatWest_Help St Annes trying to get an important matter resolved. It is still not resolved and I am regretting switching my account to you.,,,,,,,
"@RevolutApp Thank you. 
I know it makes sense, that's why I spent ages making sure I wasn't missing the setting in the app. Thanks for the response üëç",,,,,,,
@whytemetal @LloydsBank @LloydsBank are a failed service to the community. They treat their customers like they are doing them a favor. They are neither trustworthy nor dependable? Their cynical adverts are untrue and pathetic. Take your custom to a reasonable business.#ByYourSide,,,,,,,
What's happened to the payment system @AskNationwide and @StarlingBank? Can't send or receive anything.,,,,,,,
Had to go to @NatWest_Help in St Annes. It was a totally different experience today from a month ago. A complete customer service fail today. The staff member was just not hearing what I was telling them and was intent on getting me out the door.,,,,,,,
"Still waiting at 48 minutes @santanderukhelp, @santanderukbiz , surely good business would be to offer to call me back rather enraging customers who need business support! https://t.co/uJtiIFrMz8",,,,,,,

"dear @monzo @CoinbaseSupport @coinbase @BBCNews @bbclaurak I ask please for help, the above cryptocurrencies companies have stolen my small amount of money from me. I ask please for any help. so incredibly depressed I feel and sad. I ask please for help",,,,,,,
@SJLheating @CooperativeBank We do!,,,,,,,
@TSB When are you going to improve the search/export functionality!? 90days is useless - and even if you must keep that - then design the date picker better to select 90 days for you - it's just rubbish,,,,,,,
